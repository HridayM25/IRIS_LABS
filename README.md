#Comparing the similarity of two movies using Sentence Similarity.

This is my submission for the "Similarity Matching of Json Documents" task. I have used two models to evaluate the similarity of two movies.
The program can be tried out by you as well, just enter the two movies you would like to compare!

The two models I used were Transformers and SBERT, though I planned to implement TF-IDF as well, but chose not to.
